Playing around with Audio
================================================


In this repo there are some rough experiment on audio and training in Spiking Neural Networks.

Components:
----------
- RockPool as the engine for training and running the Spiking Network: https://rockpool.ai/index.html

- Heidelberg Spiking Dataset with spoken digits [1][https://zenkelab.org/resources/spiking-heidelberg-datasets-shd/]
